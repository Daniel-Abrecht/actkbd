* Why yet another keyboard daemon ?

Because I needed a daemon that:

- is small and simple
- is NOT X Window based, so that it's usable even from the console
- can execute external programs
- can handle key combinations


* What about the other daemons

I had a look at the following:

- lineakd:
    pros: modules
    cons: X-based

- pbbuttonsd:
    pros: not X-based (IIRC)
    cons: could not find how to execute external programs, Mac-centric,
	bloated with PM stuff and other non-keyboard stuff.

- esekeyd
    pros: not X-based, executes external programs
    cons: does not support key combinations

    I used a self-modified (i.e. with limited combination support) esekeyd
    for quite some time, until I decided to write my own daemon.

- keyed
    pros: not X-based, executes external programs
    cons: alpha, with fork() issues (according to the author)

- evkeyd
    pros: not X-based
    cons: no external program execution, no key combinations


* Does it work ?

I have performed some minimal testing and it seems to work fine. I will have
to receive quite a lot of feedback before I mark it as stable, though.


* How does it work ?

To find out read the `Internals' section in the README. Then read the source
code itself for details.


* I found a bug !

Good! Now report it to me at <nyb@users.sourceforge.net>... or even better fix
it and send a patch!


* How can I help ?

- Test it!
- Report bugs!
- Ideas, suggestions e.t.c. are welcome. Patches even more :-D
- Occasionally you may drop a line to say that it worked for you. Positive
  feedback is just as important.


* I don't like your coding style

I don't like yours either.


* Who wrote it ?

Me, Theodoros Kalamatianos, a student at the department of Electric and Computer
Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens. For purposes related
to actkbd I may be reached at <nyb@users.sourceforge.net>.


* Under what license is it released ?

Naturally, the GNU General Public License. The full text of the GPL is included
in the actkbd tarball.
